/*
‚úÖ What the Callback Does:It‚Äôs a function that Node.js automatically calls once the file read operation finishes ‚Äî either:
with an error (err is not null), or with a result (file content in result)

üîç Why Use a Callback? Because file reading takes time (especially on larger files or over networks), you don‚Äôt want your entire app to pause. Instead, you tell Node:

"Go read this file. When you're done, call this function with the result (or error)."
So other code can keep running in the meantime.

// if i want to append content instead of overriding
fs.appendFileSync("./text.txt",`${Date.now()}hello there\n`) //make sure to commentout line3

//to delete a file ---fs.unlinkSync("path")
